# sql_peer_review_project
Yelp database profiling and analysis as part of a data science course, final peer review assignment.

This project's objective is to help people understand the data scientist's job and excercise important concepts we went through during the course.
Main topics include manipulating strings, date functions, CASE statements and of course joins and sub-queries.

In order to get a greade we were asked to first grade 4 assignments made by other peers which helped alot to understand the importance of clean code writing,
and of course made it much clear that its easy to get data from a query, but its not always the right data.
